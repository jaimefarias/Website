								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>Throughout my academic career I always strive to accomplished great things,
									whether it be maintaining high grades or being successful in extra curricular activities.
									For example, taking dual enrollment courses while being on the varsity basketball/tennis team and
									the science U.I.L team was always a lot too handle but I learned how to overcome this
									heavy workload with time management. Not only did I manage to keep myself afloat with all
									of this work, I excelled in almost every aspect of it. I was one of the captains on my varsity
									basketball team that lead my team to the playoffs, I also made it to the tennis regional tournament
									in mixed doubles. As well as the extra curricular side I excelled in my science U.I.L team being
									the first and only student (at the time) to make it to regionals for physics for my teacher,
									also graduating top 10 in my class because of the work I had put in to academics as a whole.
									I believe this state of mind has transferred well in my time at college and will continue
									throughout my career, I refuse to lose or quit when I put my mind to something.
									As I have progressed to get my degree the classes have gotten harder but I always
									adjust and make sure to set myself up for success.</p>
								<h2>Soft Skills</h2>
								<p>As stated above I believe I have skills that could prove to be useful to any company
									or workplace that my skills are needed. All 5 of the soft skills that I mentioned in
									the previous page are important parts in a developing computing professional. First,
									throughout my life how to problem solve effectively whether it be a problem I'm stuck
									on or a group project where my team doesn't know how to start I will figure out a way
									to get the work done/started. Second, I have been on plenty teams and know how to handle
									various scenarios that involve teamwork which is especially good since almost all computing
									professionals work in groups/teams. Third, I have always been determined and motivated when
									I put my mind to something especially if I enjoy what I'm doing, I plan to put this
									determined heart to the test in my industry. Fourth, with that determination comes a
									strong work ethic you need this if you want to be successful long term in anything
									you do in life. So I decided early on to get my work ethic to a point where I can set out
									to accomplish anything knowing I gave it my all. Lastly, I have adapted to everything thrown
									at me in life whether it be failing a test and learning from those mistakes to pass the next
									one or just overcome personal problems that arise, I always do the things I set out to do. </p>
								<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
								<p>This is my least defined area of my life as I am still learning and growing as a computing
									professional. Though I have picked up some stuff on the way to becoming one, such as
									having foundational knowledge in many languages like Java, C++, and C. I have also gotten
									familiar with the agile methods used in my industry. In many of my classes I have had to
									use them for group projects or assignments. Because of my minor am familiar with the
									basics of business and the terminology and wouldn't be lost if I heard business talk
									or terms used. I have been a part of two groups that made two apps/programs that were
									feature complete and ready to be used by people, one being a note card app and the other
									being a Zoo management system. I plan on growing my technical skills as I get closer to
									graduation and ready to show my industry I am ready for it.
								</p>
								<h2>Personal hobbies</h2>
								<p>I know my concentration on technology is on the software side but I as an individual
									am also interested on the hardware side of things. I enjoy learning about computers
									and their parts, I know how to assemble one and how to spot issues in most of them.
									Not only am I interested in computers but technology in general I am fascinated with,
									I would love to build/create something that is useful for people in some way, shape
									or form. </p>
